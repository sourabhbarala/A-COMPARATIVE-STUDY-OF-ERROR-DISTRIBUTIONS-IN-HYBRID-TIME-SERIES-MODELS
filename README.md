# A-COMPARATIVE-STUDY-OF-ERROR-DISTRIBUTIONS-IN-HYBRID-TIME-SERIES-MODELS
Involves using various error distributions in GARCH and EGARCH models to extract parameters, which are then utilized as input features for LSTM models. Later, different ensemble techniques will be applied to combine model outputs and evaluate improvements in forecast accuracy.
